                    <h3>Data analysis</h3>
                    <p>I have completed many engineering projects utilising a wide variety of data, such as Computational Fluid Dynamics, Robotics and Non-Destructive Testing,
                        while also using machine learning, deep learning, SQL and coding in many languages. I have ultimately tailored these skills to the finance domain by
                        focusing on market data and information. I am able to use my data skills to assess options and product pricing, algorithmic trading models and risk management.
                        Although I am primarily concerned with the finance area, I can apply my data analysis skills to any problem that may come my way.

                    <h3>Quantitative Finance</h3>
                    <p>With my extensive skillset in multiple coding languages, my financial experience in traded products and trading teams as well as my knowledge of multivariate 
                        and stochastic calculus, I had an excellent base on which I built my quantitative finance knowledge. I have been able to understand quickly most 
                        pricing models and options trading strategies, as well as advanced algorithmic trading and market-making strategies. I always look forward to the new 
                        challenges Quantitative Finance brings, and I look forward to a life-long career in the industry.

                    <h3>Programming and Software Development</h3>
                    <p>I have created many programmes using MATLAB, including a 3D printing software and a CFD turbulent flow simulator which aided in my supersonic rocket
                        engine simulations and analysis. I have also created many scripts in MATLAB, Python, among others, as I am always looking for new challenges. Recently I created
                        a C# windows application which used an SQL backend, a Winforms GUI created using .NET, a class library and text file storage for referencing.

            <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--about">An engineering Masters graduate with programming and banking experience</p>

            <div class="about-me__body">
                <p>I have a 2:1 (with Honours) Masters degree from the University of Bristol, and this provided me with excellent problem-solving, analytical and data and programming
                    skills. During my degree I completed many projects including Robotics, Fluid Mechanics, Thermodynamics and Finite Element Analysis. These projects allowed me to
                    become very comfortable with MATLAB, Python, Java, as well as deriving information from a wide range of data sources and complexities. As I progressed, I focused
                    more and more heavily on coding and data analysis, as this is what I enjoyed the most. I thrived on problems where it was necessary to find information within
                    seemingly uncorrelated or disparate data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Along with my course, I was also heavily involved in the Bristol Electric Racing Team, being the deputy head of the Electrical team and responsible for the 
                    majority of the powertrain team. This experience gave me excellent teamwork skills as well as organisational and planning skills as there were many external deadlines
                    to reach while I managed a team of 60 engineers of varying skill level and availability. My experience at Lloyds Banking Group formalised my previous learning
                    as this enabled me to understand how to work and function most efficiently in a large, multifaceted team while maintaining client relationships, the company's 
                    vision and service quality. My interaction with the trading floor and the team behind it showed me where it was I wanted to be. Since then I have spent my free 
                    time trading from home using a mix of fundamental and algorithmic trading strategies and learning as much as I can about the trading world, both the skills
                    and techniques required, as well as the wider trading world by studying for the IMC qualification.
